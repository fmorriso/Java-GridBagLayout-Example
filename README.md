## Notes
GridBagConstraints allows you to set the following properties to control the layout of individual components:
* `gridx`: The column of the grid.
* `gridy`: The row of the grid.
* `gridwidth`: The number of columns a component spans.
* `gridheight`: The number of rows a component spans.
* `weightx, weighty`: How the extra space is distributed.
* `anchor`: How the component is aligned within its grid cell.
* `fill`: Determines how the component should resize within the grid cell.
